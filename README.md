# LLM's

LLM's works on fundementals of predicting the next word in the sequence. kind of self learning rather than traditional ML supervised learning tasks.

Three Levels of using LLM's

1. Promt Engineering - (not touching any of model parameters, just use as it is ) ex: easy way - Chat GPT, not so easy way - OpenAI API, Open source HuggingFace Transformer API's
2. Model Fine tuning - adjusting atleast one model internal parameter for a particular task. Ex: get a pretrained LLM from huggingface and update the model parameters for a specific tasks. 
3. Build your own LLM. - get our own data, train, modelling
